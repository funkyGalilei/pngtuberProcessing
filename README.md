# Creating a png Live Character in Processing

I saw cool projects like pngTuber+ and veadotube and wanted to recreate part of its functionality for my own character to use in making draw along videos! 

Instead of having a sound change the displayed png, I wanted to have the sound input map to an image in an image sequence - creating the illusion of a part of a 3D model rotating smoothly.

some functionality I wanted to add:
- GUI using Processing libraries
- breathing animation using sin waves
- 2 separate states of talking
- supporting animations from different image sequences
- visualizer of incoming audio

The end result is intended to be used with OBS or a chroma key filter applied, since I couldn't get the transparency to work right in Processing.

I have also started to learn Processing, and its super easy to use which made this wayyy more fun :)
